## Start Server

1. Clone this git repository
2. Install deps with the commandÂ `npm install`
3. Start server with the command `npm start`

## Configure NX runner

To use remote build you need to use an other runner than the default one.

Change the `tasksRunnerOptions` section into `nx.json` by:

```json
"tasksRunnerOptions": {
  "default": {
    "runner": "./extension",
    "options": {
      "cacheableOperations": ["build", "lint", "test", "e2e"],
      "bucket": {
        "url": "http://localhost:3333/api"
      }
    }
  }
},
```

If you deployed this into a server, change `http://localhost:3333` by your own server address.

## Test remote cache

1. Build the application: `npm run nx -- build todos`
2. Go to `node_modules/.cache` folder and delete `nx`
3. Run again the build command: `npm run nx -- build todos`
4. You got message that inform you the build comes form cache

# Next steps

- Create docker image for the server
- Publish the extension library
